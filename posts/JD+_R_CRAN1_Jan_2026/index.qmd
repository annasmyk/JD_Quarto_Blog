R packages giving access to JDemetra+ version 3: {rjd3toolkit}, {rjd3x13} and {rjd3tramoseats} are on CRAN !

You can install the latest release 
```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("rjd3toolkit", "rjd3x13", "rjd3tramoseats"))
```

and use, among other things, all the related modelling and Seasonal Adjustment procedures. 

They are based on a new hidden package {rjd3jars}.	 
	
We will upload on CRAN all the remaining rjdverse packages ({rjd3bench}, {rjd3highfreq}, {rjd3workspace}...) in the coming weeks/months.

They are all already available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rjdverse) and on [R-Universe](https://rjdverse.r-universe.dev/packages)

For installation procedures and examples have a look at the README files and related GitHub pages.
