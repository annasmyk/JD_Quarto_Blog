A very lively 5th Edition of the **Time Series Analysis for Official Statistics** Workshop took place at OECD, Paris, La Muette, France on **December 3rd and 4th 2025** and via Zoom.

We were (almost) live on LinkedIn thanks to Dario Buono 

The two main topics were Nowcasting and Seasonal Adjustment, with several talks were related to JDemetra+. All presentations are available at: [https://one-communities.oecd.org/community/workshop-on-time-series-methods-for-official-statistics/SitePages/Home.aspx](https://one-communities.oecd.org/community/workshop-on-time-series-methods-for-official-statistics/SitePages/Home.aspx)

We were delighted to spend time with some of you ! Very fruitful discussions and good mood and a bit of drama... thank you for attending !

See you next year !
